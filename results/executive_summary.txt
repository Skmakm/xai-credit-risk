EXPLAINABLE AI FOR CREDIT RISK PREDICTION
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

KEY FINDINGS:

1. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
   - Best Accuracy: 0.813
   - Best ROC-AUC: 0.753

2. INTERPRETABILITY ASSESSMENT:
   - Most Interpretable: Logistic Regression
   - Least Interpretable: Xgboost

3. ACCURACY VS INTERPRETABILITY TRADE-OFF:
   - High interpretability models: Logistic Regression (0.680 accuracy)
   - High accuracy models: Random Forest (0.813 accuracy)
   - Balanced approach: XGBoost (0.760 accuracy)

4. ETHICAL AI IMPLICATIONS:
   - All models provide different levels of transparency
   - SHAP explanations reveal feature importance globally
   - LIME explanations provide local instance-level insights
   - Trade-offs between performance and explainability must be considered

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use Logistic Regression for regulatory compliance (high interpretability)
- Use XGBoost for balanced performance and explainability
- Use Random Forest when accuracy is prioritized
- Implement both SHAP and LIME for comprehensive explanations
- Consider domain-specific interpretability requirements
